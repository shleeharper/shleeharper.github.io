A super simple responsive portfolio template. It's only a single page because hey, sometimes
you don't need a half dozen pages to make your point.

How to update on Github: medium article: https://medium.com/tunapanda-institute/8-steps-to-publish-your-portfolio-on-github-9d6e6e3d2e84

Only have to clone once. Didn't have to put in credentials to update anymore (only once).

cd = change directory
ls = list files in directory
pwd = print working directory (where am I)
